# Console-Finances

## Description 

This is a Javascript written to showcase skills in manuplating multidimension Arrays. This script is analysing the array and collecting the total number of months of a given period. Keeping track of changes in the profits of the period on a monthly basis and returning average. It goes further to compute the greatest increase and decrease in the profits/Losses for the period. This is part of my learning journey  towards web development.
