# Console-Finances

## Description 

This is a Javascript written to showcase skills in manuplating multidimension Arrays. This script is analysing the array and collecting the total number of months of a given period. Keeping track of changes in the profits of the period on a monthly basis and returning average. It goes further to compute the greatest increase and decrease in the profits/Losses for the period. This is part of my learning journey  towards web development.

## Task
You have been given a dataset composed of arrays with two fields, Date and Profit/Losses.

Your task is to write JavaScript code that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

* The total number of months included in the dataset.

* The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

* The average of the **changes** in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
  * You will need to track what the total change in profits are from month to month and then find the average.
  * (`Total/Number of months`)

* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

* The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.


## Challenges

* Interpretation of the task requirement as errors in the acceptance criteria we found. 
* Accesing data in a multidimension array.
* Spliiting data in the multidimension array
* Analyzing and creating reports .

## Things I learned 
* Accessing specific data in a multidimension Array
* Rounding of values to the nearest 100th.
* Creating new array form a Multidimensin Array
* Got a better understanding of how to read product documentation.
